//Another way to time your animations is with a callback function!
//You can have a function as your thrid parameter. There are no more parameters you can pass after you use a function in the third spot, so if you need to do more functions, you would have to call them withing the fucntion that is being passed. 

//The function is executed as soon as the animation is finsihed. 

//It can get complex very fast if you overdo it. It is useful that you can do anything once an animation is finished!

//for this challenge, use the animate function to make your own animation and then incorporate what you have leaned with callback function.
